# sitelen_pona_command
A BetterDiscord plugin that adds /os to send a sitelen pona image

Requires ZeresPluginLibrary for the options menu to work

To install:
1. Have BetterDiscord installed and working. See https://betterdiscord.app/FAQ for help with this.
2. Download the [SitelenPona.plugin.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveredOxygen/sitelen_pona_command/main/SitelenPona.plugin.js) file
3. Go into Discord's settings. Scroll down to find "Plugins" in BetterDiscord's section, then click on it.
4. Click where it says "Open Plugins Folder" at the top.
5. It should open a file manager. Drag the plugin into it.
6. Enjoy being able to send sitelen pona as your own account! Use /os to do it.

For the plugin to be useful, you need to have a sitelen pona font installed. 
By default it uses linja sike, but you can change it in the plugin's settings.
If you don't want to install a font, you can add linja sike to your discord through css.
Paste this in the "Custom CSS" section of settings, then click save and update:
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: "linja sike 5";
    src: url(https://wyub.github.io/tokipona/linja-sike-5.otf);
}
```
